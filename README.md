# CiEnLi

CiEnLi is a library of historical ciphers implemented in (rust)[https://www.rust-lang.org/].

## The list of ciphers must add:
- [x] Vigen√®re
- [x] ROT5
- [x] ROT13 
- [x] ROT18
- [x] ROT47
- [x] Bacon
- [x] Caesar
- [x] XOR
- [ ] Playfair
- [ ] Rail-fence
- [ ] Fractionated Morse

- [ ] Straddle Checkerboard
- [ ] Bifid
- [ ] Homophonic
- [ ] Four-Square
