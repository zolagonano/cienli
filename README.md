# CiEnLi

CiEnLi is a library of historical ciphers implemented in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

**WARNING**: I just learned [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and I made this as my first project. So it may have lots of bugs.

## The list of ciphers must add:
- [x] Vigen√®re
- [x] ROT5
- [x] ROT13 
- [x] ROT18
- [x] ROT47
- [x] Bacon
- [x] Caesar
- [x] XOR
- [x] Atbash
- [x] Affine
- [x] Scytale
- [ ] Playfair
- [ ] Rail-fence
- [ ] Fractionated Morse

- [ ] ADFGVX
- [ ] Straddle Checkerboard
- [ ] Bifid
- [ ] Homophonic
- [ ] Four-Square
- [ ] Autokey

If you have cipher in mind that there is no inside list, please add it to the list :)
